Thinkfan is a simple, lightweight fan control program. Originally designed
specifically for IBM/Lenovo Thinkpads, it now supports any kind of system via
the sysfs hwmon interface (/sys/class/hwmon). It is designed to eat as little
CPU power as possible.



WARNING!!!!
===========

There's only very basic sanity checking on the configuration (semantic
plausibility). You can set the temperature limits as insane as you like.

Any change to fan behaviour that results in higher temperatures in some parts
of the system will shorten your system's lifetime and/or cause weird hardware
bugs that'll make you pull out your hair.

   No warranties whatsoever.

If this program steals your car, kills your horse, smokes your dope or pees
on your carpet...
 - too bad, you're on your own.




Building and installing
=======================

In the main directory, do
 
 mkdir build && cd build

You can use ccmake to choose build options interactively:

 ccmake ..

Or set your build options from the command line. E.g. to configure a debug
build with support for libatasmart:

 cmake -D USE_ATASMART:BOOL=ON -D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE:STRING=Debug .

Use CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE:STRING="Release" to get an optimized build without debug
symbols. If you use the proprietary nVidia driver and want to control your GPU
temperature, set USE_NVML:BOOL=ON.
To compile simply run:

 make

CMake should also provide you with a "make install" target, which defaults to
a /usr/local prefix.
